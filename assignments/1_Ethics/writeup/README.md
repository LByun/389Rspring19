### Part 2 (75 pts)

I would inform and consult several members of my team and get them to start brainstorming of ways to fix the issue. This way other people are aware of the situation and getting rid of me won't stop the spread of the information. At first, as an employee of the company I would try to keep the issue within the company. I would try to persuade them once the public found out about this, it would hurt the company far much more. If my boss told me to stop the fix and work on the ECU's release instead, I would inform them that I cannot while the ECU has this issue. If I am fired for this, I would then inform consumer watchdogs and the appropriate government agencies.  
If you are aware that people can get injured and you do nothing, I believe that ethically and legally you should be held responsible because, as the auditor, it was your job to prevent these types of issues. However, if you see a giant pot hole on the road, and you think to yourself "Someone's tired cold pop and they could die from driving over that cliff." And a week later this exact situation happens, I don't believe you should be held responsible. Personally, I would feel some what guilty though. There are a lot of variables at to consider but generally, it is my personal belief that you should inform others of a dangerous situation if you are aware of one.
