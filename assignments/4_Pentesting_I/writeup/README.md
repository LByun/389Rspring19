## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (40 pts)

The flag I found was CMSC389R-{digging_f0r_flag5_thr0ugh_Injec7tion} in the flag.txt file. I noticed that netcat would immediately kick me out after I had entered the IP address. Reading through the article that was linked in the README, I noticed in one of the examples they used a ; to link multiple commands and decided to try it; I was unaware that you could use semicolon to do that with commands. Going into netcat again I entered "142.93.136.81; ls" and it gave me a list of directories. I then looked into each directory until I looked in the 'home' directory and found the 'flag.txt' file. The command I entered to read the flag was '142.93.136.81;cd home; cat flag.txt', which gave me the flag listed above. I would recommend v0idcache sanitize the inputs in order to prevent users from injecting their own commands. Another recommendation would be to set a max length the input could be to prevent other types of injection attacks.
